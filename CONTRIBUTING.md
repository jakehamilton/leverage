# How To Contribute

Firstly, thanks for joining the project! Here are the steps you can
take to get your change implemented in the library:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/jakehamilton/leverage).

2. Create a new branch, preferably using one of the following scopes (eg. feature/x):
    + feature
    + fix
    + chore
    + docs

3. Make your change, being sure to:
    + Run the test suite with `yarn test`.
    + Add/Remove tests as needed for your change.
    + Run the linter with `yarn lint`.

4. Once you've made your change, commit with `yarn commit` and follow the instructions.

5. Push your commits up to your fork and send a pull request!
    + If you have multiple commits, please make sure the history is nice and clean (you can use `git rebase -i` to squash commits).
